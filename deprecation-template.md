# Summary

One paragraph explanation of the deprecation.

# Motivation

Why are we doing this? What are the problems with the deprecated feature?
What is the replacement functionality?

# Transition Path

This is the bulk of the RFC. Explain the use-cases that deprecated functionality
covers, and for each use-case, describe the transition path.

Describe it in enough detail for someone who uses the deprecated functionality
to understand, for someone to write the deprecation guide, and for someone
familiar with the implementation to implement.

# How We Explain This

Does it drastically impact the driver's understanding?
What kinds of things could we say to explain this to end-users.

What should we do about documentation, in the wiki
related to this feature?

How should this deprecation be introduced and explained to existing OpenPilot
users?

# Drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this? Please consider the impact on the driver of all types of vehicles supported by openpilot, on the integration of this feature with other existing and planned features,
on the impact of the API churn on existing comma services, etc.

There are tradeoffs to choosing any path, please attempt to identify them here.

# Alternatives

What other designs have been considered? What is the impact of not doing this?

# Unresolved questions

Optional, but suggested for first drafts. What parts of the design are still
TBD?
