# (RFC title goes here)

## Summary

> One paragraph explanation of the feature.

## Motivation

> Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected
outcome?

## Detailed design

> This is the bulk of the RFC.

> Explain the design in enough detail for somebody
familiar with the framework to understand, and for somebody familiar with the
implementation to implement. This should get into specifics and corner-cases,
and include examples of how the feature is used. Any new terminology should be
defined here.

## How We Explain This To Drivers

> What names and terminology work best for these concepts and why? How is this
idea best presented? As a continuation of existing openpilot usage, or as a
wholly new one?

> What should we do about documentation, in the wiki
related to this feature?

> How should this feature be introduced and taught to existing openpilot
end-users (aka non-developers)?

## Drawbacks

> Why should we *not* do this? Please consider the impact on the driver of all types of vehicles supported by openpilot, on the integration of this feature with other existing and planned features,
on the impact of the API churn on existing comma services, etc.

> There are tradeoffs to choosing any path, please attempt to identify them here.

## Alternatives

> What other designs have been considered? What is the impact of not doing this?

## Unresolved questions

> Optional, but suggested for first drafts. What parts of the design are still
TBD?
